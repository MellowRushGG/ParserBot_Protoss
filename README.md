# ParserBot_Protoss
It's this guy's bot, except I changed it to Protoss instead of Terran: https://github.com/Frigerius/StarCraft2ReplayParser

Follow his instructions for everything and make sure you know how to work VS's linker/additional-include-directories thing

Right now I'm trying to get it to output map data in something like 86x86 pixel outputs, but I spent all day transcribing enums from Terran to Protoss so my brain is too (e)numb to do something as complicated as that so I'm uploading it for anyone else who wants just the build-order analysis (which is functional). You could probably put together a good B.O.S.S system with what's here already, but, as Google just showed us, an LSTM NN trained on a bunch of high-level replays is much faster for online/real-time play
